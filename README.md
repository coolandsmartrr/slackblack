# Slackblack

You were able to use Slack in dark mode with a more simple injection of Javascript prior to v4.0.0. However, the new update changed the file directory of Slack.app, so now there are more steps involved in applying this modification. This simple script aims to automate this process.

Steps:
--

Automatic execution

1. Run `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coolandsmartrr/slackblack/master/slackblack.sh)`
2. Enter password

Manual execution

1. `mv` to this directory
2. Run `chmod +x ./slackblack`
3. Run `./slackblack`
4. Enter password
